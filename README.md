We tried to use D3 to display the COVID mortality rates for each state on an interactive map. We started by using the guide to make a basic HTML page that runs on the express server. Due to limited time, we used a template on D3 as a foundation for our JS code, with the goal of using a different data source from a different file. However, we ran into a lot of trouble connecting everything together with our original foundation. The code given identified each state by a numberic value but our data set had each state by abbreviation. It would have taken a long time to change our data set so it could be by the full state name or numeric value.
