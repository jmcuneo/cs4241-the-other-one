## ICE 03: Anagrams in React

https://ice-03-jacobs-salls-foley.glitch.me

# Note:
We have this project working when you run the main server and the react client locally, but we 
didn't manage to get hosting working, nor could we get them both running locally via the npm
start command. The hosted version is not running via react, but you can see the react scripts in the
jacobs_salls_foley folder.
