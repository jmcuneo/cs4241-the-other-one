Our app was supposed to be a simple piano application. We used Nexus as well as Tone to create an interactive keyboard. The only instruction is that to play a note, you can click on the corrosponding key on the webpage. Except in this case, instead of audio, it outputs text of what the note WOULD have been, had we gotten the audio working. 

We all kinda worked on various bits and pieces throughout the process. We also had a giant reset that cost us like 45 minutes of our work.
